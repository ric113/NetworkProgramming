Project III: Remote Batch System (rbs) in HTTP.

In this homework, you are asked to write a remote batch system in HTTP.  

(1) Write a CGI program to receive an HTTP request described as follows.

A sample which consists of parameters of the HTTP request is as the following:

    h1=140.113.210.101      # the first server's IP.
    p1=7000                 # the first server's port.
    f1=batch_file1          # the batch file name redirected to the first ras server.
    h2=140.113.210.103      # the second server's IP.
    p2=7000                 # the second server's port.
    f2=batch_file2          # the batch file name redirected to the second ras server.
    h3=140.113.210.103      # the third server's IP.
    p3=7001                 # the third server's port.
    f3=batch_file3          # the batch file name redirected to the third rwg server.
    h4=                     # no more server. 
    h5=                     # no more server. 

Then, the CGI program connects to the three ras or rwg servers and then
redirects the batch file (stored in the HTTP server) as input to these servers.  
When receiving messages, send these messages back to the browser as the returning web page.  
Note that the returning web page includes several columns, 
one for displaying the returning messages from each server.  
A sample of the web page is given on the board. 

        <html>
        <head>
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=big5" />
        <title>Network Programming Homework 3</title>
        </head>
        <body bgcolor=#336699>
        <font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#FFFF99>
        <table width="800" border="1">
        <tr>
        <td>140.113.210.145</td><td>140.113.210.145</td><td>140.113.210.145</td></tr>
        <tr>
        <td valign="top" id="m0"></td><td valign="top" id="m1"></td><td valign="top" id="m2"></td></tr>
        </table>
        <script>document.all['m0'].innerHTML += "****************************************<br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m0'].innerHTML += "** Welcome to the information server. **<br>";</script>
		<script>document.all['m0'].innerHTML += "****************************************<br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "****************************************<br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "** Welcome to the information server. **<br>";</script>
		<script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "****************************************<br>";</script>
		<script>document.all['m0'].innerHTML += "% <b>ls</b><br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "% <b>removetag test.html</b><br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "<br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "Test<br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "This is a test program<br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "for ras.<br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "<br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "<br>";</script>
        <script>document.all['m1'].innerHTML += "% <b></b><br>";</script>
        ....
        </font>
        </body>
        </html>

Requirements: 

* The number of target servers is not greater than 5.

* The information about batch is sent by users by GET method (only).

* The parameters will be either complete or all missing,
    e.g, http://yourserver/?h1=140.113.111.111&p1=5555&f1=t1.txt&h2=&p2=&f2
    in this case parameter for server 1 is complete, parameters for server2 is missing,
    i.e, you don't need to consider the case of partly missing parameters.

* Your CGI program should show one table which lists the results from your ras/rwg servers in real time.

* There are five cells in the table, and the results from your ras/rwg server must be listed in corresponding cell.
     That is, the content from 1st ras/rwg server will not be displayed in 2nd cell to 5th cell.

* You should not use fork() in CGI, instead, you should use non-blocking connect/select/read/write.

* A large file will be tested, that is, you should not suppose that write will always success. You should handle write event properly.



(2) Write a simple http server in Unix to support CGI.  

Requirements:

* This must work with TA's CGI programs (samples will be posted) and the previous 
  CGI you wrote.  

* Only parameters in GET method should be processed. 

* All file's name of which ends with ".cgi" should be interpreted as a executable file and should be invoked.

* It is not cared if requested file does not exist.

* You have to setup all the environmant variables (totally 9) in page 8 of http.pdf(Professor's course slides) when you execute CGI program, and the content of these environmant variables except "QUERY_STRING" can be anything you want.(Content of QUERY_STRING MUST be correct.)
    Ex: REMOTE_ADDR="140.113.185.117" or "remote address" or "anything I want"

* Do NOT use the http server provided by CS workstation, use the NP workstation.


(3) http server + CGI in Windows
* You are asked to implement a simple http server which only provides the remote batch service, that is, it is the combination of 1st part and 2nd part.

* This server must be implemented by winsock.

* The client connections(i.e. the connections to your ras/rwg server) must be implemented in event driven model(WSAAsyncSelect).

* The functionality of the CGI part must be same with Part 1.
